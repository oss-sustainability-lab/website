  title: Visioning
  description: The visioning chapter grounds the OSS Lab curriculum in a unique approach to sustainability, grounded in taking stock of relationships, the framework of abolition, and the connection of both to our individual and institutional capacities for change. The two modules feature lighting talks by Miliaku Nwabueze and Camille Acey and explore different approaches to these ideas. The talks are accompanied by exercises and activities as well as suggested readings.
