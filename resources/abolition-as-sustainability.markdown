excerpt: "In this module, Miliaku Nwabueze offers a grounding framework for sustainability work rooted in pairing sustainability with abolition. To this end, she offers an introductory essay and lighting talk that ground the exercises that follow. Additional resources round out her offering and invitation to ground sustainable visions of the work in the recognition of harm, repair, and care in our interpersonal relationships."

In professional settings it might seem odd to hone and utilize interpersonal skills, but in open-source projects, these skills are essential. When we think about sustainability, we often think about it through neoliberal frameworks—how do we sustain ourselves, our projects, our organizations? But abolition asks us to think about sustainability differently: not just how do we sustain, but what are we sustaining? Abolition invites us to design sustainable care, to create infrastructures that don't just maintain the status quo but transform it. In this way, our interpersonal relationships become a form through which our worlds become evident.

Juxtaposing abolition inspired infrastructures with sustainability reveals what's possible when we center care, repair, and transformation in our work. In open-source software, we often talk about sustainability in terms of funding, maintenance, and technical debt. But what if we also thought about sustainability in terms of how we care for each other, how we repair harm, and how we transform the conditions that make harm possible? This isn't just about making our projects more sustainable—it's about making our communities more sustainable, about creating conditions where care and repair can flourish, where our relationships can sustain our passion and care. (See: "No One Resigns Energized" in resources.)

If we understand ourselves to have "power" or an ability to change, shift, or solve something, we must also accept that we are currently in a state that needs changing, shifting, or solving. This acceptance can be difficult—it requires us to acknowledge our own complicity, our own participation in systems of harm. But it's also necessary if we want to create something different. The challenge is not just to imagine a better world, but to recognize the ways in which we are currently preventing ourselves from becoming who and what we need to be.

There's a difference between solving a problem and stopping one. Solutionism is the Silicon Valley idealism that suggests every problem has a technical solution, that we can code our way out of any difficulty. But solutionism often obscures the root causes of problems, focusing instead on symptoms and surface-level fixes. When we approach sustainability through a solutionist lens, we risk creating solutions that don't actually solve anything—they just manage the problem, contain it, make it more palatable. In this way, solutionism can actually prevent us from addressing the underlying conditions that make problems possible, and can even sustain the persistence of our problem statements.

For example, let's suppose I live in a city where people steal a lot. A solutionist approach might be to build more prisons, hire more police, create better surveillance systems. But an abolitionist approach asks: why are people stealing? What conditions make theft necessary or appealing? What would need to change so that theft is no longer a viable or necessary option? Abolition isn't just about getting rid of prisons and police—it's about creating a world where prisons and police aren't needed, where the conditions that make them necessary no longer exist. This is like unraveling an old sweater: you don't just cut the threads, you carefully undo the knots, understanding how each thread is connected to the others, until the whole thing comes apart. And in that unravelling, you see not just the absence of the sweater, but the presence of something new—the yarn, the possibility of making something different. In the same way, abolition isn't just about the absence of prisons and police, but about the presence of communities that care for each other, that prevent harm before it happens, that repair harm when it does occur. This vision isn't utopian—it's practical, it's happening in communities around the world, and it's sustained not by the absence of problems, but because they exist.

Transformative Justice is a framework which focuses on shifting contexts by giving us a healing method that doesn't rely on the state or on punishment. Unlike restorative justice, which often still operates within carceral logics (restoring things to how they were, which might have been harmful in the first place), transformative justice asks: what would need to change so that this harm doesn't happen again? It's not just about addressing the immediate harm, but about transforming the conditions that made such harm possible in the first place.

Missions like transformative justice stem from a clear vision of abolition and could be a wonderful basis for sustainable open-source work. Abolition, as *Ruth Wilson Gilmore* reminds us, is "the presence of an absence of a thing." It's not just about what we're getting rid of, but about what we're creating in its place. When we think about sustainability in open-source, we might ask: what harmful contexts are we sustaining? What would need to be present—what care, what repair, what transformation—for us to no longer need the things that cause harm? This is the work of abolition: not just imagining a world without prisons, without police, without exploitation, but creating the conditions where those things are no longer necessary, where they can't exist, not because they've been banned or eliminated, but because they exist.
